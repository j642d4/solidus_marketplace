Solidus Marketplace is a Solidus is an extension to add support for suppliers and drop shipping to Solidus.  It is a fork from the Spree Drop Ship extension.

What is drop shipping?

This is marketplace implementation for solidus.

Basic functionality:
* Links products to one or more suppliers
* Once an order is placed:
  * A shipment is created for the product's supplier
  * The shipment is then sent to the store owner for fulfillment and to the supplier for visibility (via Email by default).
  * The store owner fulfills orders. The supplier can view their shipments (read-only for now).

Installation
------------
Here's how to install solidus_marketplace into your existing spree site AFTER you've installed Spree:

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'solidus_marketplace', github: 'solidus/solidus_marketplace'

Make your bundle happy:

    bundle install

Now run the generator:

    rails g solidus_marketplace:install

(Optional) Run the generator for solidus_gateway to enable the use of Stripe or other payment providers
included with that extension:

    rails g solidus_gateway:install

Then migrate your database if you did not run during installation generator:

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

And reboot your server:

    rails s

You should be up and running now!

Sample Data
-----------

If you'd like to generate sample data, use the included rake tasks:

```shell
rake db:seed                         # Loads seed data into the store
rake spree_sample:load               # Loads sample data into the store
rake spree_sample:suppliers          # Create sample suppliers and randomly link to products
rake spree_sample:marketplace_orders # Create sample marketplace orders
```

This will include a new role (supplier_admin) and 2 new users in addition to the default 'admin@example.com' user provided by solidus.

Those users have the following email/password/roles

* marketmaker@example.com / test123 / admin
* supplier_admin@example.com / test123 / supplier_admin
